              `A "technocapital singularity" is Land's term for an autonomous, accelerating feedback loop between technology and capitalism that has escaped human control. He views this process as the primary agent of history, an inhuman force reshaping the planet.`,
              `Land pinpoints the start of this process to the European Renaissance, around 1500. He argues that the combination of rational, scientific thinking ("rationalitization") and global exploration for trade ("oceanic navigation") created the conditions for global capitalism ("commoditization") to begin its explosive growth. The first corporations, the Dutch and English India companies established in 1600 and 1602, is an example.`,
              `This is a key tenet of Land's thought. He equates the market with a form of distributed, non-human intelligence. For him, capitalism is not just an economic system but a planetary-scale computation, an engine for building its own successor: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).`,
              `The "machine runaway" is the process of technocapital improving and accelerating itself ("auto-sophisticating"). As it gets faster and more interconnected, it actively dissolves traditional social structures like the nation, community, and family.`,
              `Land frames politics and the State as a fundamentally conservative, decelerating force. In the face of capitalism's runaway acceleration, politics does not lead but reacts, attempting (and ultimately failing) to contain or "get a grip" on a process it can no longer control.`,

            "annotations": [
              "\"Planetary Commercium\" is another name for the global market system, framed as an emergent, autonomous entity. Land lists the previous world-systems it has destroyed in its rise, showing its power over different forms of political and social order.",
              "The Holy Roman Empire was a pre-capitalist, territorial, and theological order whose power was based on divine right and feudal hierarchy. For Land, it represents a 'cold,' static system based on 'status and meaning' that was rendered obsolete and ultimately dissolved by the rise of the rational nation-state and the fluid, monetarized power of early global markets.",
              "The Continental System (1806-1814) was a top-down, state-led attempt by Napoleon to impose a political blockade on Great Britain. It is a quintessential example of a rigid political project trying to contain the fluid flows of the emerging global market. Its failure demonstrated that capital's deterritorializing power had already become stronger than traditional statecraft.",
              "The Soviet Union's collapse demonstrated the inability of a centralized, top-down political system (socialism) to compete with an adaptive decentralized market (capitalist democracies).",

              "This describes the feedback loop of late 20th-century power. Capital pushes for freedom from state control (\"deregulation\"), while the state tries to reassert control through new forms of surveillance and weaponry (\"arms-race\"), creating an escalatory spiral."

It describes a shift from the human model of "vertical" reproduction (parent to child, creating a stable lineage) to a "bacterial" model of "horizontal" information transfer.

For him, "Neo-China" represents the political model that is the ultimate product of the meltdown: a society that has embraced technocapitalist acceleration without the Western baggage of humanism, democracy, or individual rights.

              `Land radically separates his idea of "revolution" from all traditional leftist and religious ideas of a final endpoint (eschatology). This revolution does not lead to a better world or a utopia. When stripped of all hope, what remains is the "burn-core of crashed security"—the raw, mechanical fact of total system failure.`,

Land frames them as an ancient, alien ("xeno") and repressed part of our biology that operate on a different, networked logic. "Hacking" their data means bypassing the hierarchical human "command core" (the nucleus/ego) to directly access and reactivate this dormant, rhizomatic potential—a "sleeper agent" inside our cells.`

They are additive rather than substitutive, and immanent^2 rather than transcendent: executed by functional complexes of currents, switches, and loops, caught in scaling reverberations, and fleeing through intercommunications, from the level of the integrated planetary system to that of atomic assemblages.
