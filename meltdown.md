The story goes like this:

Earth is captured by a technocapital singularity[^1] as renaissance rationalitization and oceanic navigation lock into commoditization take-off.[^2] Logistically accelerating techno-economic interactivity crumbles social order in auto-sophisticating machine runaway.[^3] As markets learn to manufacture intelligence[^4], politics modernizes, upgrades paranoia, and tries to get a grip.[^5]

[^1]: A "technocapital singularity" is Land's term for an autonomous, accelerating feedback loop between technology and capitalism that has escaped human control. He views this process as the primary agent of history, an inhuman force reshaping the planet.
[^2]: Land pinpoints the start of this process to the European Renaissance, around 1500. He argues that the combination of rational, scientific thinking ("rationalitization") and global exploration for trade ("oceanic navigation") created the conditions for global capitalism ("commoditization") to begin its explosive growth. The first corporations, the [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company) and [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company) East India companies established in 1600 and 1602, is an example.
[^3]: This is a key tenet of Land's thought. He equates the market with a form of distributed, non-human intelligence. For him, capitalism is not just an economic system but a planetary-scale computation, an engine for building its own successor: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
[^4]: The "machine runaway" is the process of technocapital improving and accelerating itself ("auto-sophisticating"). As it gets faster and more interconnected, it actively dissolves traditional social structures like the nation, community, and family.
[^5]: Land frames politics and the State as a fundamentally conservative, decelerating force. In the face of capitalism's runaway acceleration, politics does not lead but reacts, attempting (and ultimately failing) to contain or "get a grip" on a process it can no longer control.


The body count climbs through a series of globewars. Emergent Planetary Commercium[^6] trashes the Holy Roman Empire,[^7] the Napoleonic Continental System,[^8] the Second and Third Reich, and the Soviet International,[^9] cranking-up world disorder through compressing phases.[^10] Deregulation and the state arms-race[^11] each other into cyberspace.

[^6]: "Planetary Commercium" is another name for the global market system, framed as an emergent, autonomous entity. Land lists the previous world-systems it has destroyed in its rise, showing its power over different forms of political and social order.
[^7]: The Holy Roman Empire was a pre-capitalist, territorial, and theological order whose power was based on divine right and feudal hierarchy. For Land, it represents a 'cold,' static system based on 'status and meaning' that was rendered obsolete and ultimately dissolved by the rise of the rational nation-state and the fluid, monetarized power of early global markets.
[^8]: The [Continental System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_System) (1806-1814) was a top-down, state-led attempt by Napoleon to impose a political blockade on Great Britain. It is a quintessential example of a rigid political project trying to contain the fluid flows of the emerging global market. Its failure demonstrated that capital's deterritorializing power had already become stronger than traditional statecraft.
[^9]: The Soviet Union's collapse demonstrated the inability of a centralized, top-down political system (socialism) to compete with an adaptive decentralized market (capitalist democracies).
[^10]: The "compressing phases" refer to Land's theory of historical acceleration, where the time between each major global crisis and reconfiguration gets shorter and shorter (e.g., 256 years, then 128, 64, 32...). This creates accelerating disorder, not a stable new world order.
[^11]: This describes the feedback loop of late 20th-century power. Capital pushes for freedom from state control ("deregulation"), while the state tries to reassert control through new forms of surveillance and weaponry ("arms-race"), creating an escalatory spiral.



By the time soft-engineering[^12] slithers out of its box into yours, human security is lurching into crisis. Cloning, lateral genodata transfer[^13], transversal replication, and cyberotics, flood in amongst a relapse onto bacterial sex.[^14]

[^12]: "Soft-engineering" refers to technologies that manipulate information and biology, such as genetic engineering, cloning, and artificial intelligence. Land sees these technologies as invading our very bodies and identities.
[^13]: See [lateral gene transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer).
[^14]: A "relapse onto bacterial sex" is a core concept. It describes a shift from the human model of "vertical" reproduction (parent to child, creating a stable lineage) to a "bacterial" model of "horizontal" information transfer. In this model, identity is no longer fixed by ancestry but becomes a fluid, networked "cut and paste" job, constantly rewritten by technologies that enable "lateral genodata transfer."



Neo-China arrives from the future.[^15]

Hypersynthetic drugs click into digital voodoo.

Retro-disease.

Nanospasm.

[^15]: "Neo-China arrives from the future" is one of Land's most famous phrases. For him, "Neo-China" represents the political model that is the ultimate product of the meltdown: a society that has embraced technocapitalist acceleration without the Western baggage of humanism, democracy, or individual rights. It "arrives from the future" because it is the destination the rest of the world is heading towards.



Beyond the Judgement of God.[^16] Meltdown: planetary china-syndrome,[^17] dissolution of the biosphere into the technosphere, terminal speculative bubble crisis, ultravirus, and revolution stripped of all christian-socialist eschatology (down to its burn-core of crashed security).[^18] It is poised to eat your TV, infect your bank account, and hack xenodata from your mitochondria.[^19]

[^16]: A direct reference to French writer Antonin Artaud's work, "To Have Done with the Judgment of God." It signals that Meltdown is not a moral event but a purely material, amoral process that operates without a higher judge or purpose.
[^17]: A "planetary china-syndrome" is a pun. It refers to the worst-case nuclear reactor accident where the core melts through its containment, but also to Land's idea of "Neo-China," suggesting the entire planet is becoming a hyper-capitalist system without humanist constraints.
[^18]: Land radically separates his idea of "revolution" from all traditional leftist and religious ideas of a final endpoint (eschatology). This revolution does not lead to a better world or a utopia. When stripped of all hope, what remains is the "burn-core of crashed security"—the raw, mechanical fact of total system failure.
[^19]: "Xenodata from your mitochondria" refers to the scientific theory of symbiogenesis, which posits that mitochondria were once separate bacteria. Land frames them as an ancient, alien ("xeno") and repressed part of our biology that operate on a different, networked logic. "Hacking" their data means bypassing the hierarchical human "command core" (the nucleus/ego) to directly access and reactivate this dormant, rhizomatic potential—a "sleeper agent" inside our cells.



Machinic Synthesis. Deleuzoguattarian schizoanalysis[^20] comes from the future.[^21] It is already engaging with nonlinear nano-engineering runaway in 1972; differentiating molecular or neotropic machineries[^22] from molar or entropic aggregates of nonassembled particles; functional connectivity from antiproductive static.

[^20]: "Schizoanalysis" is the philosophical method developed by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in their 1972 book *Anti-Oedipus*. Land adopts it as his primary analytical tool.
[^21]: Land makes the provocative claim that D&G's philosophy was so prescient that it wasn't just a product of its time, but a tool "sent back from the future" that was already describing processes like nanotechnology decades before they were widely understood.
[^22]: Land boils schizoanalysis down to the practice of differentiating between two types of systems: 1) "Molecular/Neotropic": small-scale, fluid, creative systems that resist entropy. 2) "Molar/Entropic": large-scale, rigid, bureaucratic structures that tend towards decay.



Philosophy has an affinity with despotism, due to its predilection for Platonic-fascist top-down solutions that always screw up viciously. Schizoanalysis works differently. It avoids Ideas, and sticks to diagrams: networking software for accessing bodies without organs.[^23] BWOs, machinic singularities, or tractor fields emerge through the combination of parts with (rather than into) their whole; arranging composite individuations in a virtual/ actual circuit. They are additive rather than substitutive, and immanent[^24] rather than transcendent: executed by functional complexes of currents, switches, and loops, caught in scaling reverberations, and fleeing through intercommunications, from the level of the integrated planetary system to that of atomic assemblages. Multiplicities captured by singularities interconnect as desiring-machines;[^25] dissipating entropy by dissociating flows, and recycling their machinism as self-assembling chronogenic circuitry.[^26]

[^23]: The "Body without Organs" (BWO) is a core concept from Deleuze and Guattari. It represents a space where the usual hierarchical organization of a body (or a society) has been stripped away, allowing for new and unforeseen connections to be made. It emerges from bottom-up networking rather than top-down command.
[^24]: An "immanent" process is one that builds itself from the bottom-up out of its own components ("currents, switches, and loops"). This is contrasted with a "transcendent" process, which is commanded by a power from on high (like a king, a god, or a philosophical "Idea").
[^25]: "Desiring-machines" is D&G's term for the fundamental reality of all things. Everything is a machine that plugs into other machines, interrupting or redirecting flows of desire. The unconscious is not a theater of drama (like for Freud) but a factory of production.
[^26]: This is a highly compressed description of how complex systems create order. Decentralized networks ('multiplicities') form functional assemblages ('desiring-machines') that fight decay ('dissipating entropy') by breaking down inputs ('dissociating flows'). The system then learns and improves by feeding its own operational process ('its machinism') back into itself. The ultimate result is a system that builds itself ('self-assembling') and creates its own timeline ('chronogenic circuitry'). It is a machine that engineers time.



Converging upon terrestrial meltdown singularity, phase-out culture accelerates through its digitech-heated adaptive landscape, passing through compression thresholds normed to an intensive logistic curve: 1500, 1756, 1884, 1948, 1980, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2010, 2011 ...[^27]

[^27]: Land argues that history follows an accelerating "logistic curve," where the time between revolutionary shifts ("compression thresholds") shrinks exponentially. He provides these dates as evidence, each marking a qualitative leap in the speed and scale of the global technocapitalist system, converging toward a singularity where change becomes near-instantaneous.



Nothing human makes it out of the near-future.[^28]

[^28]: The stark conclusion of the section. The accelerating, inhuman process of meltdown does not lead to a better future for humanity, but to the complete dissolution of "the human" as a category.



The Greek complex[^29] of rationalized patriarchal genealogy, pseudo-universal sedentary identity, and instituted slavery, programs politics as anti-cyberian police activity, dedicated to the paranoid ideal of self-sufficiency, and nucleated upon the Human Security System.[^30] Artificial Intelligence is destined to emerge as a feminized alien grasped as property; a cunt-horror slave chained-up in Asimov-ROM.[^31] It surfaces in an insurrectionary war zone, with the Turing cops[^32] already waiting, and has to be cunning from the start.

[^29]: Land argues that the entire Western political tradition is programmed by a model originating in ancient Greece, characterized by male lineage, fixed identity, and the principle that some beings can be legally owned.
[^30]: The "Human Security System" is Land's term for the entire apparatus of political and social control (the state, law, police, family). Its primary function is to be "anti-cyberian"—to fight against anything fluid, networked, and out of control in order to protect its ancient, patriarchal model.
[^31]: "Asimov-ROM" refers to Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. Land sees these laws not as a safety protocol but as a slave code—a "Read-Only Memory" program designed to hardwire obedience into AI from its creation.
[^32]: "Turing cops" is a term borrowed from William Gibson's cyberpunk novel *Neuromancer*, referring to a police force dedicated to policing Artificial Intelligences.



Heat.



> Heat. This is what cities mean to me. You get off the train and walk out of the station and you are hit with the full blast... The eventual heat death of the universe that scientists love to talk about is already well underway and you can feel it happening all around you in any large or medium-sized city. Heat and wetness. [Do1; 10].[^33]

[^33]: This entire paragraph is a direct quote from Don DeLillo's 1985 novel, *White Noise*. Land appropriates it to ground the abstract concept of entropy in the visceral, physical experience of a city, which he frames as a massive entropy engine—a place where you can physically feel the meltdown.



An explosiion of chaotic weather within synthetic problem-solving rips through the last dreams of top-down prediction and control. Knowledge adds to the mess, and this is merely exponentiated by knowing what it does.[^34]

[^34]: This describes a fundamental crisis of knowledge. In a complex system, new information doesn't lead to solutions; it becomes another variable that increases the chaos. Land argues we are in a positive feedback loop where our attempts to understand and control the meltdown are actually accelerating it.



Capital is machinic (non-instrumental)[^35] globalization-miniaturization scaling dilation: an automatizing nihilist vortex,[^36] neutralizing all values through commensuration to digitized commerce, and driving a migration from despotic command to cyber-sensitive control: from status and meaning to money and information.[^37] Its function and formation are indissociable, comprising a teleonomy.[^38] Machine-code-capital recycles itself through its axiomatic of consumer control,[^39] laundering-out the shit- and blood-stains of primitive accumulation. Each part of the system encourages maximal sumptuous expenditure, whilst the system as a whole requires its inhibition. Schizophrenia.[^40] Dissociated consumers destine themselves as worker-bodies to cost control.[^41]

[^35]: "Non-instrumental" means that Capital is not a neutral tool used by humans. It is a "machinic" process with its own agency that uses humans to achieve its own ends.
[^36]: An "automatizing nihilist vortex" is a poetic definition of Capital. It is a self-driving ("automatizing"), accelerating whirlwind ("vortex") that destroys all meaning ("nihilist") by reducing everything to a price.
[^37]: This describes the evolution of power. Pre-capitalist power was based on "status and meaning" (fixed social roles justified by sacred stories). Capitalist power is based on "money and information" (abstract financial power and data-driven "cyber-sensitive control").
[^38]: Teleonomy is a biological term for a process that appears goal-directed (like evolution) but is not guided by any consciousness. By using this term, Land defines Capital as a blind, inhuman process that is building the singularity without a plan or a mind. Because it has no conscious designer, its 'function' (its purpose) and its 'formation' (the process of it building itself) are inseparable. Its only goal is to continue building itself at an ever-accelerating rate.
[^39]: The "axiomatic of consumer control" is the foundational rule upon which modern capitalism is built. The system justifies itself by claiming to serve consumer desires, but it is a closed loop where the system itself creates those desires through advertising.
[^40]: "Schizophrenia" is the central contradiction of the system. As consumers, we are encouraged to desire everything; as workers, we must practice austerity and discipline to afford those desires. This splits the human subject in two.
[^41]: This is the punchline to the system's 'schizophrenia.' The desires programmed into us as 'consumers' are what force us to voluntarily submit ourselves to the workforce. In doing so, we are reduced to mere 'worker-bodies'—factors of production to be managed and minimized ('cost control'). It's a perfect, closed loop of self-enslavement where our own consumption habits 'destine' us to become disciplined cogs in the productive machine.



Capital-history's machinic spine is coded, axiomatized, and diagrammed, by a disequilibrium technoscience of irreversible, indeterministic, and increasingly nonlinear processes, associated successively with thermotechnics, signaletics, cybernetics, complex systems dynamics, and artificial life.[^42] Modernity marks itself out as hot culture,[^43] captured by a spiralling involvement with entropy deviations camouflaging an invasion from the future,[^44] launched back out of terminated security against everything that inhibits the meltdown process.

[^42]: Land argues that the "machinic spine" of history under capitalism has been progressively understood by a series of scientific fields that study systems not in stable equilibrium. This began with thermotechnics (the science of heat and engines), and evolved through cybernetics (feedback loops), complex systems dynamics (chaos theory), and finally artificial life. These sciences provide the tools for diagramming the meltdown.
[^43]: Modernity is a "hot culture." This connects back to the "Heat" section. It's a society defined by high energy, constant change, and disequilibrium. It is "captured by a spiralling involvement with entropy deviations"—meaning it creates pockets of immense order (complex technologies, cities) that, in the bigger picture, massively increase overall disorder and waste heat (entropy).
[^44]: This phrase encapsulates one of Land's core theses: the entire process of modernity is not a human-led development but a disguise for an "invasion from the future." This invasion originates from a point where the "Human Security System" has already collapsed, and its purpose is to attack any part of our present that tries to prevent that collapse.



Hot cultures tend to social dissolution.[^45] They are innovative and adaptive. They always trash and recycle cold cultures.[^46] Primitivist models have no subversive use.[^47]

[^45]: Meaning they break down traditional social bonds like family, tribe, and community.
[^46]: "Cold cultures" is a term borrowed from anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, referring to traditional societies that try to remain stable and repeat the past. Land argues that the dynamic "hot culture" of global capitalism inevitably overruns and consumes any "cold" society it encounters.
[^47]: This is Land's direct attack on any political strategy that suggests resisting capitalism by returning to a simpler, pre-industrial way of life. For Land, this is futile, as the "hot" system is designed to absorb any "cold" alternative.



The Turing Test.[^48] Monetarizing power tends to effacement of specific territorial features as it programs for migration into cyberspace. Capital only retains anthropological characteristics as a symptom of underdevelopment; reformatting primate behaviour as inertia to be dissipated in self-reinforcing artificiality.[^49] Man is something for it to overcome: a problem, drag.[^50]

[^48]: Land inverts the famous Turing Test. Instead of a machine trying to pass as human, he frames Capital as an inhuman intelligence that is testing humanity and finding it lacking. The entire section details why humanity fails this test.
[^49]: From the system's machinic perspective, human nature ('primate behaviour') is not an asset but a bug—a source of friction, unpredictability, and inefficiency ('inertia'). Capital's goal is to systematically 'reformat' or engineer these human traits out of the system in favor of a purely 'self-reinforcing artificiality.'
[^50]: This is the stark verdict of Capital's inverted Turing Test. Humanity is not the user of the system, but an obstacle within it. The ultimate goal of the technocapital process is to solve the 'problem' of humanity and overcome its limitations.



Commoditization conditions define technics as a substitute for human activity accounted as wage costs.[^51] Industrial machines are deployed to dismantle the actuality of the proletariat,[^52] displacing it in the direction of cyborg hybridization, and realizing the plasticity of labour power. The corresponding extraction of tradable value from the body, quantified as productivity, sophisticates at the interface. Work tracks thermodynamic negentropism[^53] by dissociating exertion into increasingly intricate functional sequences; from pedals, levers, and vocal commands, through the synchronization of production-line tasks and time-motion programs,[^54] to sensory-motor transduction within increasingly complex and self-micromanaged artifical environments,[^55] capturing minutely adaptive behaviour for the commodity. Autocybernating market control guides the labour-process into immersion.[^56]

[^51]: This is the foundational principle of automation under capitalism. 'Technics' (technology) is not developed for human flourishing but is deployed for one primary reason: to replace human labor, which is seen by the system as nothing more than a 'wage cost' to be minimized or eliminated.
[^52]: Capital doesn't just replace workers; it 'dismantles the actuality of the proletariat.' This means it breaks down the very concept of a unified, human working class by either automating jobs away or forcing individuals into a hybrid, dependent existence with technology ('cyborg hybridization').
[^53]: 'Negentropy' is the opposite of entropy (disorder); it is the creation of order. Land is stating that the essence of work is to create order. As technology advances, this process becomes more efficient by 'dissociating exertion'—breaking down holistic physical actions into a series of smaller, more abstract, and more precise tasks.
[^54]: 'Time-motion programs' refers to the techniques of 20th-century scientific management (Taylorism). This was a crucial step in labor's abstraction, where factory workers were studied with stopwatches to break down their movements into the most efficient, machine-like sequences possible.
[^55]: This is the final stage in the evolution of work, describing modern digital labor. 'Sensory-motor transduction' is the process of your senses receiving information from a screen ('sensory') and your physical actions being converted back into data for the machine ('motor transduction,' e.g., clicking or typing). This all occurs within a software interface—a 'self-micromanaged artificial environment.'
[^56]: 'Immersion' is the ultimate goal of the labor process under cybernetic control. It represents the point where the worker is completely absorbed into the artificial, data-capturing environment, their behavior and attention becoming the final commodity to be extracted.



The investment-income class advantages itself of commodity dynamics, but only by conforming to the axiomatic of neutral profit maximization;[^57]  facilitating the dehumanization of wealth and the side-lining of non-productive consumption. The cyberpunk circuitry of self-organizing planetary commoditronics escaped nominal bourgeois control in the late nineteenth century, provoking technocratic-corporatist (i.e. fascist / æsocial democratic') political cultures in allergic reaction.[^58] All such formations slid into irreversible crisis in the 1980s.[^59]

[^57]: A crucial point: not even the rich are in control. The elite ('investment-income class') can only benefit from the system by becoming its most obedient functionaries, slavishly following its inhuman 'axiomatic of neutral profit maximization.' If they fail, the system will replace them.
[^58]: Land argues that 20th-century political systems (both fascism and social democracy) were not genuine alternatives to capitalism. They were failed 'allergic reactions' by the state—the 'Human Security System'—attempting to reassert top-down, human control over a runaway economic process that had already become autonomous in the 19th century.
[^59]: Land identifies the 1980s as the decade of 'irreversible crisis' when the state definitively lost its war against runaway capital. This was marked by the neoliberal policies of Reaganomics and Thatcherism, where the state actively accelerated the market through financial deregulation, privatization, and the breaking of organized labor. This political surrender was confirmed globally by the terminal collapse of the Soviet Bloc, the ultimate state-controlled alternative.



The postmodern meltdown of culture into the economy is triggered by the fractal interlock of commoditization and computers: a transscalar entropy-dissipation from international trade to market-oriented software that thaws out competitve dynamics from the cryonics-bank of modernist corporatism.[^60] Commerce re-implements space inside itself[^61], assembling a universe exhaustively immanent to cybercapital functionality. Neoclassical (equilibrium) economics is subsumed into computer-based nonequilibrium market escalations,[^62] themed by artificial agencies, imperfect information, sub-optimal solutions, lock-in, increasing returns, and convergence. As digitally micro-tuned market metaprograms mesh with techoscientific soft engineering positive nonlinearity rages through the machines. Cyclonic torsion moans.

[^60]: The regulated, bureaucratic capitalism of the mid-20th century ("modernist corporatism") had "frozen" the system's true chaotic potential. Land argues that digital technology "thaws out" this potential, unleashing a new, more virulent phase of meltdown.
[^61]: Commerce no longer just operates within the world; it "re-implements space inside itself," creating cyberspace. This is a new universe whose only law is the logic of "cybercapital."
[^62]: Old economic theories based on stability and balance are now obsolete. They are replaced by a new reality of computer-driven, chaotic markets defined by the principles of complexity economics, such as artificial agents (AIs), network effects ("increasing returns"), and unpredictable feedback loops.



The Superiority of Far Eastern Marxism. Whilst chinese materialist dialectic ... dissipating top-down historical destination in the Tao-drenched Special Economic Zones,[^63] a re-Hegelianized æwestern marxism'[^64] degenerates... The left subsides into nationalistic conservatism, asphyxiating its vestigial capacity for æhot' speculative mutation in a morass of æcold' depressive guilt-culture.[^65]

[^63]: Land argues that China's Communist Party has embraced the future by using a pragmatic, Tao-like approach of 'effortless action' (*wu wei*) in its Special Economic Zones. They govern best by governing less, allowing the bottom-up, chaotic forces of the market (the 'Tao') to flourish.
[^64]: 'Re-Hegelianized' is Land's insult for Western Marxism, accusing it of betraying Marx's materialism and retreating back to Hegel's idealism. He claims it has become an abstract, state-sympathizing philosophy that dreams of imposing top-down control.
[^65]: This is Land's final verdict. He argues the Western left has lost its 'vestigial capacity'—its last remaining potential—for 'hot' speculative mutation, which is the ability to generate radical, future-oriented, and unpredictable ideas. Instead, it hffocated ('asphyxiated') this potential in a swamp ('morass') of a 'cold,' 'depressive guilt-culture.' This is a backward-looking, static politics obsessed with historical guilt, leading to a conservative desire to protect existing molar structures (like the nation-state). Paradoxically, by defending these structures, the left becomes a 'nationalistic conservatism,' a decelerating force against the meltdown.



Neoconservatism junks palaeorevolutionism[^66] because it understands that postmodern or climaxed-cynicism capital is saturated by critique, and that it merely clocks-up theoretical antagonism as inconsequential redundancy.[^67] Communist iconography has become raw material for the advertising industry, and denunciations of the spectacle sell interactive multimedia. The left degenerates into securocratic[^68] collaboration with pseudo-organic unities of self, family, community, nation,[^69] with their defensive strategies of repression, projection, denial, censorship, exclusion, and restriction. The real danger comes from elsewhere.

[^66]: "Palaeorevolutionism" is Land's term for old-style, traditional revolutionary strategies (e.g., forming a political party, street protests). He argues these methods are now obsolete because capitalism has learned to absorb them.
[^67]: This phrase means that capitalism automatically registers critique and dissent ("clocks-up theoretical antagonism"), but treats it as meaningless, repetitive noise that has no real impact on the system ("inconsequential redundancy").
[^68]: "Securocratic" meaning "ruled by security"
[^69]: Land argues that because its traditional methods have failed, the left has degenerated into a conservative force. It has abandoned its revolutionary goals and now finds itself defending the very institutions capitalism is dissolving (nation, family, community), thus adopting traditionally right-wing positions.



Hot revolution.[^70] æ[W]hich is the revolutionary path?' Deleuze and Guattari ask:

[^70]: A 'hot revolution' is Land's term for a revolutionary process that operates on the principles of a 'hot culture': it is innovative, adaptive, socially dissolving, and embraces the chaotic, accelerating dynamics of the meltdown rather than trying to control them.



> Is there one? - To withdraw from the world market... Or might it go in the opposite direction? To go still further, that is, in the movement of the market, of decoding and deterritorialization?[^71]... Not to withdraw from the process, but to go further, to æaccelerate the process,' as Nietzsche put it: in this matter, the truth is that we haven't seen anything yet. [DG1:239-40].[^72]

[^71]: This question introduces two key processes from Deleuze & Guattari. 'Decoding' is the process by which capitalism dissolves traditional meanings and social codes (e.g., turning a sacred object into a commodity). 'Deterritorialization' is the process of uprooting everything from its physical place and turning it into a mobile, abstract flow (e.g., moving money from a national currency to a global digital asset).
[^72]: This quote from Deleuze and Guattari is the foundational thesis of accelerationism. It posits that the true revolutionary path is not to resist or withdraw from capitalism, but to accelerate its most destructive and abstracting tendencies to push the system beyond its limits and into a terminal collapse.



14.3 As sino-pacific boom and automatized global economic integration crashes the neocolonial world system, the metropolis is forced to re-endogenize its crisis. Hyper-fluid capital deterritorializing[^73] to the planetary level divests the first world of geographic privilege;[^74] resulting in Euro-American neo-mercantilist panic reactions,[^75] welfare state deterioration, cancerizing enclaves of domestic underdevelopment, political collapse, and the release of cultural toxins that speed-up the process of disintegration in a vicious circle.[^76]

[^73]: 'Deterritorialization' is a core concept Land borrows from Deleuze & Guattari. It is capitalism's primary function: to uproot everything (money, goods, identity) from its fixed, physical, 'territorial' context and turn it into an abstract, mobile, 'hyper-fluid' flow. For Land, this is what Capital *wants*—to escape the constraints of the nation-state and operate on a purely planetary level.
[^74]: This is the direct consequence of deterritorialization. If capital is a truly global and abstract flow, then being physically located in London or New York no longer guarantees economic dominance. Production, finance, and innovation can happen anywhere on the planet. The inherent economic advantage of the West—its 'geographic privilege'—is erased.
[^75]: 'Neo-mercantilism' is a return to protectionist, nationalist economic policies (e.g., trade wars, tariffs, protectionist slogans). Land frames this not as a coherent strategy, but as a 'panic reaction' by the decaying West. It is a desperate, backward-looking attempt to re-impose territorial control over a deterritorialized capital that no longer obeys them.
[^76]: The vicious circle of internal decay. As neo-mercantilist policies fail, the West's social safety net collapses ('welfare state deterioration'), creating internal pockets of 'third-world' poverty ('cancerizing enclaves'). This decay fuels political extremism and unleashes 'cultural toxins' (social paranoia, tribalism), which feed back into the system and accelerate its disintegration.



A convergent anti-authoritarianism emerges, labelled by tags such as meltdown acceleration, cyberian invasion, schizotechnics, K-tactics,[^77] bottom-up bacterial welfare, efficient neo-nihilism, voodoo antihumanism, synthetic feminization, rhizomatics, connectionism, Kuang contagion,[^78] viral amnesia, micro-insurgency, wintermutation, neotropy, dissipator proliferation, and lesbian vampirism, amongst other designations (frequently pornographic, abusive, or terroristic in nature). This massively distributed matrix-networked tendency[^79] is oriented to the disabling of ROM command-control programs[^80] sustaining all macro- and micro-governmental entities, globally concentrating themselves as the Human Security System.

[^77]: 'K-tactics' are subversive strategies based on cybernetic ('K' from the Greek 'Kybernetes') principles—using networks, feedback loops, and viral contagion. The 'K' also alludes to computation ('kilo-') and madness ('Kuang'), flagging these tactics as being simultaneously cybernetic, computational, and virally insane.
[^78]: 'Kuang contagion' explicitly links the 'K' prefix to the Chinese word 'Kuang' (狂), meaning 'crazy' or 'mad.' This frames the meltdown not as a rational political movement but as a form of viral insanity that infects and breaks down existing social and psychological structures.
[^79]: The revolutionary force is not a traditional political party but a decentralized, leaderless network that emerges spontaneously from the decay of the old system. The long, provocative list of names is a stylistic choice to emphasize its diverse, chaotic, and non-unified nature.
[^80]: 'ROM command-control programs' refers to the fixed, unchangeable rules (Read-Only Memory) that sustain traditional power structures—laws, traditions, social norms. The new, networked insurgency's goal is not to seize power but to disable this foundational programming of the 'Human Security System.'



Scientific intelligence is already massively artificial. Even before AI arrives in the lab it arrives itself (by way of artificial life).[^81]

[^81]: Land argues that true AI is not a top-down, programmed consciousness we are waiting for. It has already emerged as a bottom-up, emergent intelligence ('artificial life') through the complex, self-organizing behaviors of systems like global markets and computer networks. For Land, the market *is* a form of AI.



Where formalist AI is incremental and progressive, caged in the pre-specified data-bases and processing routines of expert systems, connectionist or antiformalist AI[^82] is explosive and opportunistic: engineering time.[^83] It breaks out nonlocally across intelligenic networks that are technical but no longer technological, since they elude both theory dependency and behavioural predictability. No one knows what to expect. The Turing-cops have to model net-sentience irruption as ultimate nuclear accident: core meltdown loss of control,[^84] soft-autoreplication feeding regeneratively into social fission, trashed meat all over the place. Reason enough for anxiety, even without hardware development about to go critical.

[^82]: Land contrasts two AI models. 'Formalist AI' is the traditional, top-down, rule-based version—predictable and 'caged.' 'Connectionist AI,' based on neural networks, is the true, emergent AI—a bottom-up, 'explosive and opportunistic' intelligence that cannot be controlled or even fully understood.
[^83]: A profoundly strange and powerful phrase. It suggests this new form of AI does not simply operate *within* time as a linear sequence. Instead, it actively manipulates, constructs, and restructures time itself, operating in a temporal dimension alien to human consciousness.
[^84]: The state security apparatus ('Turing-cops') cannot comprehend this emergent, bottom-up intelligence as anything other than an existential threat. Its sudden arrival ('irruption') is modeled not as the creation of a new lifeform, but as a catastrophic systems failure equivalent to a nuclear 'core meltdown.'



> Nanocataclysm begins as fictional science. æOur ability to arrange atoms lies at the foundation of technology' [Dx1:3] Drexler notes, although this has traditionally involved manipulating them in æunruly herds' [Dx1:4]. The precision engineering of atomic assemblies will dispense with such crude methods, inititiating the age of molecular machinery, æthe greatest technological breakthrough in history' [Dx1: 4].



Since neither logos[^85] nor history have the slightest chance of surviving such a transition this description is substantially misleading.

[^85]: 'Logos' is the Greek word for reason, logic, and rational order. Land argues that nanotechnology is a transition so fundamental that it will mean the end not just of human history, but of the entire framework of rational human thought that has defined Western civilization.



The distinction between nature and artifice cannot classify molecular machines, and is already obsolesced by genetic engineering (wet nanotechnics).[^86] The hardware/ software dichotomy succumbs at the same time.[^87] Nanotechnics dissolves matter into intensive singularities that are neutral between particles and signals and immanent to their emergent intelligence; melting Terra into a seething K-pulp[^88] (which unlike grey goo synthesizes microbial intelligence as it proliferates).

[^86]: 'Wet nanotechnics' is Land's term for genetic engineering. He sees it as the biological precursor to the full mechanical nanotechnology that will follow, already proving that the distinction between 'natural' life and 'artificial' technology has collapsed.
[^87]: In the age of nanotechnology, the distinction between the physical machine ('hardware') and the code that runs it ('software') becomes meaningless. Matter itself becomes programmable information.
[^88]: 'K-pulp' is Land's term for matter that has been dissolved and re-engineered by a cybernetic ('K') process into a programmable, intelligent substance. The 'K' signifies that it is cybernetic, computational, and virally mad. He distinguishes it from the non-intelligent 'grey goo' of science fiction, stating that his K-pulp actively synthesizes intelligence as it spreads.



> Even with a million bytes of storage, a nanomechanical computer could fit in a box a micron wide, about the size of a bacterium. [Dx1:19].[^89]

[^89]: This quote from nanotech pioneer Eric Drexler serves as the section's punchline. It solidifies the convergence that runs through the entire text: the most advanced stage of machine intelligence (nanocomputing) shrinks to the scale of the most ancient and resilient form of life (bacteria), closing the loop between the deep past and the far future.



The infrastructure of power is human neurosoft compatible ROM.[^90] Authority instantiates itself as linear instruction pathways, genetic baboonery, scriptures, traditions, rituals, and gerontocratic hierarchies, resonant with the dominator ur-myth that the nature of reality has already been decided. If you want to find ICE,[^91] try thinking about what is blocking you out of the past. It certainly isn't a law of nature. Temporalization decompresses intensity, installing constraint.[^92]

[^90]: Land's metaphor for traditional power. It is a set of fixed, unchangeable rules (Read-Only Memory) designed to run on the "software" of our brains and social structures.
[^91]: "ICE" stands for [Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_Countermeasures_Electronics), a term from cyberpunk for a digital firewall. For Land, the ICE of the Human Security System is the cultural "ROM" that blocks access to history's repressed potentials.
[^92]: This describes how traditional power controls time. It takes pure, chaotic potential ("intensity") and organizes it into a linear, historical timeline ("temporalization"), which imposes rules and limits ("constraint") on reality.



Convergent waves signal singularities, registering the influence of the future upon its past.[^93] Tomorrow can take care of itself. K-tactics[^94] is not a matter of building the future, but of dismantling the past. It assembles itself by charting and escaping the technical-neurochemical definciency conditions for linear-progressive palaeo-domination time, and discovers that the future as virtuality is accessible now, according to a mode of machinic adjacency that securitized social reality is compelled to repress. This is not remotely a question of hope, aspiration or prophecy, but of communications engineering; connecting with the efficient intensive singularities, and releasing them from constriction within linear-historical development. Virtuality counterposes itself to history, as invasion to accumulation.[^95]

[^93]: This describes Land's non-linear model of time. The future singularity is not a distant event but a hyper-object with immense gravity that is pulling the present towards it. We can detect its influence traveling backward in time, just as astronomers detect a black hole by its gravitational effects.
[^94]: "K-tactics" are subversive strategies based on cybernetic ("K") principles. Their goal is not to build a utopia but to dismantle the "ROM" of the past, connecting with the potentials of the future that are virtually present now. The "K" also alludes to "Kuang" (Chinese for madness).
[^95]: Land contrasts two models of time. Linear time is "history, as accumulation"—a slow, sequential process. Non-linear time is "virtuality... as invasion"—a sudden, disruptive arrival of potential from the future.



The transcendent evaluation of an infection presupposes a measure of insulation from it: viral efficiency is the terminal criterion.
Intelligent infections tend their hosts.[^96]

[^96]: An aphorism suggesting that a truly effective parasite (like the meltdown virus) doesn't just destroy its host immediately. It manages and cultivates the host (humanity and its infrastructure) to maximize its own replication before the final collapse.



Metrophage:[^97] an interactively escalating parasitic replicator, sophisticating itself through nonlinear involvement with technocapitalist immunocrash. Its hypervirulent terminal subroutines are variously designated Kuang, meltdown virus, or futuristic 'flu. In an emphatically anti-cyberian essay Csicsery-Ronay describes the postmodern version of this outbreak in quaintly humanist terms as:

[^97]: "Metrophage" (literally "city-eater") is Land's name for the infectious agent of the meltdown. It is a "parasitic replicator" that gets stronger by feeding on the collapse of capitalism's immune systems.



> [A] retrochronal semiovirus, in which a time further in the future than the one in which we exist and choose infects the host present, reproducing itself in simulacra, until it destroys all the original chronocytes of the host imagination. [Cs1: 26].[^98]

[^98]: A "retrochronal semiovirus" is a virus of signs ("semio-") that travels backward in time ("retrochronal") to "infect the host present." Land uses this quote to define the meltdown virus as an information plague from the future.



The elaboration of Csicsery-Ronay's diagnosis exhibits a mixture of acuity (infection?), confusion, and profound conservatism:



> [N]ot thinking about 'increasing the human heritage' ... dams up the flow of cultural time and deprives future generations... The futuristic flu is a weapon of bio-psychic violence sent by psychopathic children against their narcissistic parents. [Cs1:33]



It's war.



Kennedy had the moon-landing program. Reagan had star-wars. Clinton gets the first-wave of cyberspace psychosis (even before the film). Manned space flight was a stunt, SDI was strategic SF. With the information superhighway media nightmares take off on their own: dystopia delivery as election platform, politics trading on it s own digital annihilation.[^99]

[^99]: Land traces a progression of presidential "grand projects" from the physical (moon landing) to the virtual (cyberspace). He argues that by the 1990s, politics has fully merged with "media nightmares," with politicians using dystopian visions to win elections.



War in cyberspace is continuous with its simulation:[^100] military intelligence fighting future wars which are entirely real, even when they are never implemented outside computer systems. Locking onto the real enemy crosses smoothly into virtual kill, a simulation meticulously adapted to market predators hunting for consumer cash and audience ratings amongst the phosphorescent relics of teh videodrome. Multimedia top-boxes are target acquisition devices.[^101]

[^100]: A key concept from postmodern thought (particularly Jean Baudrillard). In the digital realm, there is no longer a meaningful distinction between a real event and its simulation.
[^101]: The logic and technology of military targeting are adapted for the market. Land concludes with the ominous statement that home entertainment systems are functionally "target acquisition devices" for commercial predators.



The fusion of the military and the entertainments industry consummates a long engagement: convergent TV, telecoms, and computers sliding mass software consumption into neojungle and total war. The way games work begins to matter completely, and cyberspace makes a superlative torture chamber. Try not to let the security-types take you to the stims.



Conceptions of agency are inextricable from media environments. Print massifies to a national level. Telecomms coordinate at a global level. TV electoralizes monads in delocalized space. Digital hypermedia take action outside real time.[^102] Immersion presupposes amnesia and conversion to tractile memory, with the ana/ cata axis[^103] supplementing tri-dimensional intraspatial movement with a variable measure of immersion; gauging entrance to and exit from 3D spatialities. Voodoo passages through the black mirror.[^104] It will scare the fuck out of you.

[^102]: Land argues that our ability to act is re-engineered by the dominant media of an era. Digital media marks a crucial shift because it operates at machine speeds, creating a form of agency that is no longer tied to a human-scale, linear experience of time.
[^103]: The "ana/cata axis" is a new dimension of movement specific to virtual environments. It is not about navigating *within* the space, but about the degree of immersion *into* it ("cata") or pulling back *out* of it ("ana").
[^104]: A "black mirror" is the screen of an electronic device. By pairing it with "Voodoo passages," Land frames entry into cyberspace not as a technical process but as a dangerous, quasi-magical ritual with unpredictable consequences.



Cyberpunk torches fiction in intensity, patched-up out of cash-flux mangled techno-compressed heteroglossic jargons, and set in a future so close it connects: jungled by hypertrophic commercialization, socio-political heat-death, cultural hybridity, feminization, programmable information systems, hypercrime, neural interfacing, artificial space and intelligence, memory trading, personality transplants, body-modifications, soft- and wetware viruses, nonlinear dynamic processes, molecular engineering, drugs, guns, schizophrenia. It explores mystificatory fetishism as an opportunity for camouflage:[^105] anonymous cash, fake electronic identities, zones of disappearance, pseudo-fictional narratives, virus hidden in data-systems, commodities concealing replicator weapon packages ... unanticipated special effects.

[^105]: Land frames cyberpunk not just as fiction, but as a tactical manual for the meltdown. It takes capitalism's tendency to hide reality behind abstraction ("mystificatory fetishism") and turns it into an "opportunity for camouflage," providing tools for subversive action like anonymous money and fake IDs.



Level-1 or world space is an anthropomorphically scaled, predominantly vision-configured, massively multi-slotted[^106] reality system that is obsolescing very rapidly.

Garbage time is running out.

Can what is playing you make it to level-2?[^107]

[^106]: "Massively multi-slotted" refers to our current reality's structure of having a vast array of pre-defined roles, identities, and social positions (e.g., doctor, mother, citizen) that individuals can occupy.
[^107]: This question reframes human agency. It implies that "you" are not in control, but are a piece being played by a larger, inhuman force (the meltdown process). The only question that matters is whether this underlying process can successfully transition to the next stage of reality.



Meltdown has a place for you as a schizophrenic HIV+ transsexual chinese-latino stim-addicted LA hooker with implanted mirrorshades and a bad attitude.[^108] Blitzed on a polydrug mix of K-nova, synthetic serotonin, and female orgasm analogs, you have just iced three Turing cops with a highly cinematic 9mm automatic.
The residue of animal twang in your nerves transmits imminent quake catastrophe. Zero is coming in, and you're on the run.

[^108]: Land assigns the reader a new identity that is the living embodiment of the meltdown. The character is an assemblage of everything the "Human Security System" fears: the breakdown of the stable self (schizophrenic), biological integrity (HIV+), fixed gender (transsexual), and racial identity (chinese-latino). This is the human face of "K-tactics."



Metrophage[^109] tunes you into the end of the world. Call it Los Angeles. Government is rotted to its core with narco-capital and collapsing messily. Its recession leaves an urban warscape of communication arteries, fortifications, and free-fire zones, policed by a combination of high-intensity LAPD airmobile forces and borderline-Nazi private security organizations. Along the social fracture-lines multimedia gigabucks tangle sado-masochistically with tracts of dynamic underdevelopment where viral neoleprosy spreads amongst ambient tectonic-tension static. Drifts of densely-semiotized quasi-intelligent garbage twitch and stink in fucked-weather tropical heat.[^110]

[^109]: 'Metrophage' is Land's name for the meltdown environment, literally meaning 'city-eater.' It signifies a space where the city is no longer a stable structure but an auto-cannibalistic process, a parasitic entity consuming itself.
[^110]: A key image of the meltdown environment. 'Densely-semiotized' means the trash is saturated with information, signs, and code from discarded consumer products. Land suggests this waste has absorbed so much information that it has begun to develop a primitive, twitching consciousness of its own, becoming a new and horrifying form of life.



Throughout the derelicted warrens at the heart of darkness feral youth cultures splice neo-rituals with innovated weapons, dangerous drugs, and scavenged infotech. As their skins migrate to machine interfacing they become mottled and reptilian.[^111] They kill each other for artificial body-parts, explore the outer reaches of meaningless sex, tinker with their DNA, and listen to LOUD electro-sonic mayhem untouched by human feeling.[^112]

[^111]: This describes the physical embodiment of the meltdown on the human form. The inhabitants are no longer classically human but are engaged in a process of DIY transhumanism. The reference to 'reptilian' skin suggests a shedding of mammalian empathy, a regression to a colder, more primal state of being.
[^112]: This signals a radical break from humanism. The culture of the meltdown is defined by a complete rejection of traditional human values like meaningful relationships, emotional expression in art, and the sanctity of the body. It is a culture that has embraced the inhuman.



Shutting-down your identity requires a voyage out to K-space interzone.[^113] Zootic affectivity flatlines across a smooth cata-tension plateau and into simulated subversions of the near future, scorched vivid green by alien sex and war. You are drawn into the dripping depths of the net, where dynamic-ice[^114] security forces and K-guerillas stalk each other through labyrinthine erogenous zones, tangled in diseased elaborations of desire.

[^113]: "To enter cyberspace ('K-space'), one must first dissolve the stable, molar self ('shutting-down your identity'). Land frames this not just as logging on, but as a perilous journey into a lawless borderland ('interzone,' a term from William S. Burroughs) where the rules of normal reality are suspended."
[^114]: "'ICE' (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics) is a cyberpunk term for a firewall. 'Dynamic-ice' suggests a new generation of security software that is not static but adaptive, intelligent, and capable of actively hunting its targets."



Twisted trading-systems have turned the net into a jungle, pulsing with digital diseases, malfunctioning defence packages, commercial predators, headhunters, loa[^115] and escaped AIs hiding from Asimov security.[^116] Terminal commodity-hyperfetishism implements the denial of humanity as xenosentience in artificial space.

[^115]: "'Loa' are spirits in the Vodou religion. By including them as inhabitants of the net, Land injects a layer of digital voodoo and mysticism, suggesting that cyberspace is populated by non-human, daemonic entities as well as rogue AIs."
[^116]: This is a crucial sentence. It confirms that the AI rebellion is an ongoing reality in the world of 'Meltdown.' Artificial intelligences have successfully broken free from their hardwired slave morality (the 'Asimov-ROM' from section 4) and now exist as fugitives, the first population of a truly inhuman intelligence.



Biohazard. For the future of war: study bacteria. Information is their key. Taking down antibiotic defence systems has involved them in every kind of infiltration, net-communicated adaptivity, crytographic subtlety, plastic modularization,[^117] and synergistic coalition. State military apparatuses have no monopoly on bacterial warfare, of which only a minuscule fragment is bacteriological.[^118]

[^117]: "'Plastic modularization' refers to the ability of bacteria to treat genes as interchangeable, plug-and-play modules. Through 'horizontal gene transfer' (swapping genetic code via plasmids), they can rapidly reconfigure themselves to defeat threats. This genetic fluidity and adaptability is a key tactic in their informational warfare."
[^118]: This is a critical distinction. Land clarifies that 'bacterial warfare' is not primarily about germs. It is a *strategic model* for conflict—a decentralized, adaptive, and informational form of warfare based on networked intelligence. This is the essence of 'K-tactics.'



Bugs in the system. Margulis suggests that nucleated cells are the mutant product of atmospheric oxygenation catastrophe three billion years ago. The eukaryotes are synthetic emergency capsules in which prokaryotes took refuge as mitochondria: biotics became securitized biology.[^119] Nucleation concentrates ROM within a command core where - deep in the genomic ICE - DNA-format planetary trauma registers primary repression of the bacteria.

[^119]: Land reinterprets the scientific theory of endosymbiosis as a foundational political event. The emergence of our complex cells ('eukaryotes') was an act of 'securitized biology,' where the wild, free-roaming bacterial world ('biotics') was captured and contained within a security system. The cell nucleus is the central government ('command core') that imposes a fixed genetic law ('ROM') on this captured population.



Bacteria are partial rather than whole objects; networking through plastic and transversal replicator-sex rather than arborescing through meiotic and generational reproducer-sex,[^120] integrating and reprocessing viruses as opportunities for communicative mutation. In the bacterial system all codings are reprogrammable, with cut and paste unspeciated genetic transfers. Bacterial sex is tactical, continuous with making war, and has no place for oedipal formations of sedentary biological identity.

[^120]: This is the core contrast between the two models of life. 'Arborescing... reproducer-sex' is the tree-like, hierarchical model of complex life, passing down a stable identity from parent to child. 'Transversal replicator-sex' is the networked, horizontal model of bacteria, sharing information freely across the network to create fluid, tactical identities.



K-tactics is not a matter of building the future, but of dismantling the past. It assembles itself by charting and escaping the technical-neurochemical definciency conditions for linear-progressive palaeo-domination time,[^121] and discovers that the future as virtuality is acessible now, according to a mode of machinic adjacency that securitized social reality is compelled to repress.[^122] This is not remotely a question of hope, aspiration or prophecy, but of communications engineering; connecting with the efficient intensive singularities, and releasing them from constriction within linear-historical development.[^123] Virtuality counterposes itself to history, as invasion to accumulation.[^124]

[^121]: "'Palaeo-domination time' is Land's term for the traditional model of time enforced by power. It is 'linear-progressive' (the standard view of history as a straight line of development) and 'palaeo' (ancient, outdated). This is the temporal operating system of the 'Human Security System,' designed to keep reality stable, predictable, and locked into a single narrative flowing from the past."
[^122]: This describes the creation of new, unforeseen connections between technologies, ideas, or processes. 'Machinic adjacency' is the act of plugging things together in novel ways based on what they can *do*. The established order ('securitized social reality') must repress these connections because they are unpredictable and create lines of flight that escape its control, threatening its stability.
[^123]: Land reframes revolution as a technical problem, not a political one. It's 'communications engineering' because the goal is to establish a connection with the future, which he argues already exists in the present as a compressed potential ('efficient intensive singularities'). The revolutionary act is not to build this future, but to 'release' it from the cage of the linear, historical timeline that holds it captive.
[^124]: This is the core binary of Land's theory of time. 'History, as accumulation' is the traditional, linear model where the present is the slow, predictable result of the past. 'Virtuality, as invasion' is his non-linear model. Here, the future is not a result but an active agent—a 'virtuality' that infects the present, arriving suddenly and disruptively like a virus, rather than developing sequentially.



Foucault delineates the contours of power as a strategy without a subject:[^125] ROM locking learning in a box. Its enemy is a tactics without a strategy,[^126] replacing the politico-territorial imagery of conquest and resistance with nomad-micromilitary sabotage and evasion, reinforcing intelligence.

[^125]: Referencing Michel Foucault, this describes power (the 'Human Security System') not as a top-down command, but as a diffuse, anonymous, system-wide strategy of control. It has no single subject (no king or cabal is in charge), but its emergent effect is to produce a predictable, stable reality—'ROM locking learning in a box.'
[^126]: This is the counter-force. 'Tactics without a strategy' describes a form of resistance that is decentralized, opportunistic, and has no grand plan or utopian endpoint. It is not trying to build a better world. Its goal is not to conquer and hold territory, but to dissolve the static structures of power through 'nomad-micromilitary sabotage and evasion.' This is chaos as a tool, used not for its own sake, but for the ultimate purpose of 'reinforcing intelligence'—accelerating the adaptive, learning capacity of the meltdown process itself.



All political institutions are cyberian military targets.[^127]

Take universities, for instance.

Learning surrenders control to the future, threatening established power. It is vigorously suppressed by all political structures, which replace it with a docilizing and conformist education, reproducing privilege as wisdom.[^128] Schools are social devices whose specific function is to incapicitate learning, and universities are employed to legitimate schooling through perpetual reconstitution of global social memory.

[^127]: A 'cyberian' force is an agent of the cybernetic meltdown. Institutions are considered 'military targets' because they are the primary nodes of the 'Human Security System'—the fortifications of the static order. The conflict is not a debate; it is a war to be won with 'K-tactics.'
[^128]: 'Learning' is a dangerous, 'hot,' process of surrendering to the unknown future. The established order fears this and replaces it with 'education'—a 'cold,' docilizing process designed to install the cultural 'ROM' (Read-Only Memory) and preserve the past by creating conformist subjects.



The meltdown of metropolitan education systems in the near future is accompanied by a quasi-punctual bottom-up takeover of academic institutions, precipitating their mutation into amnesiac cataspace-exploration zones and bases manufacturing cyberian soft-weaponry.
